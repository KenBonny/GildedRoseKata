# The Gilded Rose kata
## By Ken Bonny

This code is based on the [Gilded Rose kata from Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata). I copied the code to get started quickly, but the base is from her.

This project has been made with [Dotnet Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1). So make sure that SDK is installed.
To run the tests, execute `dotnet test`
To run the 30 day example, execute `dotnet run`

To make it easy to run the application, execute the `execute.ps1` powershell script or the `./execute.sh` shell script, depending on your OS and favourite shell.
